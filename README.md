#  AboutMe App

In this app I wanted to play with a few things I've learnt during my Udemy courses. So there are my GitHub repositories fetched by GitHub's API, WebView with GitHub and YouTube pages some segues and app apearance settings which uses user defaults.

#### Known Issues
- I don't know why but I can't use my logo from Assets.xcassets file in LaunchScreen.storyboard. Logos of Swift, Python of C# works in launchscreen but my logo doesn't. So that's why there is LaunchLogo.png file.
